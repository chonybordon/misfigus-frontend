<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to fix untranslated technical keys appearing on the Profile screen. They have provided a comprehensive list of user-friendly translations for all required keys across six supported languages (Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, German, Italian). The goal is to make the Profile screen fully localized, clean, and professional, ensuring a consistent experience for international users.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (from the latest user request):**
1.  **Translate Profile Keys:** Add user-friendly translations for all specified  keys into the  file for all six supported languages.
2.  **Default Language:** Spanish () must be the default language for any user who has not yet selected a language.
3.  **Fallback Logic:** Implement a translation fallback order: 1st) selected language, 2nd) Spanish (), 3rd) English (). The app must never display raw translation keys.
4.  **Date Formatting:** Ensure dates (like the Terms & Conditions acceptance date) are formatted in a human-readable, locale-friendly way.
5.  **Verification:** Confirm that after the fix, the Profile screen is fully translated, language switching works correctly, and the UI appears polished in all languages.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack sticker trading app (MisFigus) with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

The following major features were implemented and tested in the last session:
-   **Freemium Model:** A free vs premium plan structure with feature gating. Free users are limited to 1 active album and 1 trade match per day. A paywall UI is shown when these limits are hit.
-   **Full Data Reset:** All user data, trades, and inventories were wiped from the database to prepare for real-user testing. The app is in a fresh start state.
-   **Trade Flow Fix:** A logic issue causing a false no trades available message was resolved. The app now correctly directs users to potential matches.
-   **Language & i18n:**
    -   Full internationalization for 6 languages (es, en, pt, fr, de, it) was implemented.
    -   Spanish () is now the default and primary fallback language.
    -   A blank screen issue on startup was fixed by implementing a safe language initialization flow.
-   **Onboarding & Auth:** A new, multi-step onboarding flow was created, starting with mandatory language selection. The flow guides new users through setting up their profile (name, location, radius, terms acceptance).

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was tasked with translating all visible keys on the Profile screen for all six supported languages. The agent had just begun analyzing the  file to plan the implementation.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent (to verify UI in different languages) and screenshot tool.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1: Implement Profile Screen Translations (P0)**
    *   **Description:** The Profile screen currently shows raw translation keys (e.g., ) instead of user-friendly text. This needs to be fixed by adding the complete set of translations provided by the user to the central  file.
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    *   **Is recurring issue?** N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None.
    *   **Issues Detail:**
        *   **Attempted fixes:** None.
        *   **Next debug checklist:**
            1.  Locate the  section within each language's translation object in .
            2.  Use  to add the user-provided translations for all six languages (es, en, pt, fr, de, it).
            3.  View  to confirm it uses  for all text elements.
            4.  Test by taking screenshots of the Profile screen after changing the language in the Settings page to verify the translations appear correctly.

**In progress Task List**:
*   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **Task 1 (P0): Fully translate the Profile screen.**
        *   **Files:** , .
        *   **Action:** Implement the translations as described in Issue 1 above. This is the only remaining task before the user considers the project ready for export.

*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   None. The user has indicated they will export the project after this final fix.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Freemium Monetization Model:** Implemented plan-based gating for albums and matches, with a paywall UI.
-   **Full Database Reset:** Wiped all transactional and user data, leaving a clean slate.
-   **Trade Flow Logic Fix:** Corrected the user flow to prevent false no trades available messages.
-   **Default Language to Spanish:** Set  as the default and primary fallback language.
-   **Blank Screen on Startup Fix:** Implemented a safe language initialization sequence.
-   **Full i18n & Onboarding Overhaul:** Added support for 6 languages and made language selection the first step of a new, comprehensive onboarding flow.
-   **Critical Bug Fixes:** Resolved issues with user name display, chat i18n, and album category translations.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   None. All previously identified issues have been addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **i18n Strategy:** Centralized JSON file () with nested keys for each language. The app uses  with a fallback chain ( ->  -> ).
*   **Freemium Gating:** Backend-enforced limits on key API endpoints (, ) based on the user's  field.
*   **State-Driven Onboarding:** A conditional router () checks the  flag to direct new users to the mandatory onboarding flow.

**key DB schema**
*   **users:** 

**changes in tech stack**
*   None.

**All files of reference**
*   : **Primary file to be modified.** Contains all UI translation strings.
*   : The screen where the untranslated keys are visible. Needs to be reviewed to ensure it uses  correctly.
*   : Handles top-level language state and initialization.
*   : Contains the API logic.
*   : Defines the database schema for users.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   Several components (, , ) have persistent linter warnings related to  dependency arrays. While not critical, resolving these would improve code quality.

**key api endpoints**
*   : Updates user data, including .
*   : An admin/test endpoint to toggle a user's plan to .
*   : Endpoint gated by the 1-album limit for free users.
*   : Endpoint gated by the 1-match-per-day limit for free users.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   Your sole priority is to implement the translations for the Profile screen using the exact keys and text provided by the user.
*   The file to edit is .
*   The default and primary fallback language for the entire application is Spanish ().
*   The user considers this the final task before they export the project. Do not introduce any new features or perform unrelated refactoring.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **USER (msg #226):** Reported a logic issue in the Trades flow. (COMPLETED)
2.  **USER (msg #250):** Requested a full reset of all demo data. (COMPLETED)
3.  **USER (msg #269):** Requested implementation of a Freemium monetization model and a Paywall UI. (COMPLETED)
4.  **USER (msg #376):** Reported untranslated keys on the Profile screen and provided complete translations for all 6 languages. **(PENDING - This is the current task)**.

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken:** The Profile screen is unprofessional due to visible raw translation keys, negatively impacting user experience.
*   **Mocked:** The Upgrade button on the paywall is mocked for testing and does not integrate with a real payment provider.

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   **Resend:** Used for sending OTP emails.
*   **react-markdown:** Used for rendering Terms & Conditions.

**Testing status**
*   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES, on all previous major features.
*   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
*   **Test files created:** None. Testing has been conducted via testing sub-agents.
*   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
*   Use any real email for OTP login. The system will send a code from . All previous user accounts have been deleted, so any login will be treated as a new user and will trigger the onboarding flow.

**What agent forgot to execute**
*   Nothing was forgotten. The agent is about to start the latest user request.</analysis>
